Project Description:

Integrated Data Processing and Analysis Pipeline
This project demonstrates the creation of a robust pipeline for extracting, processing, and analyzing data. It retrieves datasets from Kaggle, processes and transforms the data using Python, and stores it in Microsoft SQL Server for further querying and analysis.

Key Features
Data Extraction:
Automated retrieval of datasets using Kaggle API endpoints.
Data Transformation:
Cleaning, transforming, and preparing data using Python and Pandas.
Database Integration:
Loading processed data into Microsoft SQL Server for efficient storage and structured querying.
SQL Analysis:
Execution of SQL queries for data manipulation, aggregation, and generation of insights.
End-to-End Pipeline:
A complete workflow, from initial data acquisition to final data analysis and reporting.
Technologies Used
Programming: Python, Pandas
Database: Microsoft SQL Server
API: Kaggle API
Data Querying: SQL
Future Enhancements
Automated scheduling for data extraction and processing.
Integration with additional data sources.
Incorporation of advanced analytics and machine learning models.
